# IMRESS_MICA_Dashboard
About the Project: 
    From June to August 2023 I particpated in the IMPRESS program at McGill University; 
    IMPRESS is an initiative that aims to promote Indigenous Undergraduate research participation across Canada.
    I was tasked with helping develop the framework for a python-based brain visualisation app.
    As a first year comp sci student this was a daunting task but throughout the course of my internship 
    I became familiar with python libraries/toolboxes such as pyvista, vtk, panel, and Brainspace.
    This app is the product of my learnings and cooperation with Oualid Benkarim whom I owe many thanks to for guiding me along the way.

Why is this Project Important?:
    Drug-resistant epilepsy is a structural abnormality in the brain with neurodegenerative symptoms that affects millions worldwide. Patients with this disorder experience seizures as well as cognitive impairments that are detrimental to their everyday wellbeing. Invasive surgery targeting the structural lesion is the common approach to control seizures and improve cognitive ability in these patients. Accurately identifying the location and extent of these lesions in the brain is of utmost importance for patients' eligibility for surgery and even for the effectiveness of the surgical intervention. 

    As part of a large ongoing project in the lab, my app will be used to provide doctors with advanced brain representations, facilitating quicker and more precise identification of these lesions. Additionally, in the later stages of development of this project, AI will be integrated to automatically detect these lesions. 

Dependencies/How to Run Code:
    Brainspace (includes various libraries that are used such as vtk, pyvista, and panel)
    I suggest using a jupyter notebook as the environment
    To run the app you will need to change file paths to your local device, these can be found in cells 2 and 4
