# IMRESS_MICA_Dashboard
From June to August 2023 I particpated in the IMPRESS program at McGill University; 
IMPRESS is an initiative that aims to promote Indigenous Undergraduate research participation across Canada.
I was tasked with helping develop the framework for a python-based brain visualisation app.
As a first year comp sci student this was a daunting task but throughout the course of my internship 
I became familiar with python libraries/toolboxes such as pyvista, vtk, panel, and Brainspace.
This app is the product of my learnings and cooperation with Oualid Benkarim whom I owe many thanks to for guiding me along the way.
